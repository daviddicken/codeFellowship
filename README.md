# codeFellowship
Is an app that allows people learning to code to connect with each other.
It allows for a user to create a user name and give details about themself.
It also allows the user to create a post (add a note) and all of their notes will 
show up on their user page. 

### Running this program
After cloning the repo you will need to create a postgresql database name codefellowship
if you wish to use a different name for your database make sure that you change it
in your application.properties.  
Speaking of application.properties you will need to update the username and password
your postgresql username and password.
After that you can run .gradelew bootRun
from the command line to get the program to start up. Once it is up go to 
localhost:8080 in your browser and click the sign up button to create a user.
Enjoy :)
